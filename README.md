# Emotion Recognition using Transformers

This repository contains code for performing emotion recognition on a Twitter dataset using HuggingFace Transformers.

## Overview
The code demonstrates the following steps:
1. Data preprocessing and analysis
2. Tokenization of text data
3. Model building using a pre-trained Transformer model (DistilBERT)
4. Fine-tuning the Transformer model for emotion classification
5. Training and evaluation of the fine-tuned model

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- HuggingFace Transformers
- Datasets library
- Accelerate
- BERTviz
- UMAP-learn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
